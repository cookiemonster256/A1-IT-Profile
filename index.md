<p>Name: Nicholas (Niki) Holik <br>
Student Number: S3906554 <br>
Student Email: s3906554@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
Background Information: Hello :), my name is Niki. I was born and raised in Australia although both my parents were raised in Serbia. I speak primarily english and some serbian. I graduated from St Albans Secondary College in 2020. Most of my free time is spent either playing games with my friends or working part-time. I also enjoy spending time with my Dog, Tesla, a full breed German Shepard. <br>

<h1>Interest in IT<h1>
<p>My interest in IT initially started at around Grade 6 through games, even though I played for a while prior to this, it was when my interest in computers and different types of technology sparked. This interest was introduced through my brother who also played games at the time. My IT knowledge is fairly bare in general with knowing all of the basics and some knowledge in IT through high school electives. <br>

I chose to come to RMIT as I felt it would best suit my needs as a student both geographically and intellectually. It is both a short commute from my residence alongside it accommodating the type of course I was interested in. Additionally, it is a short distance to travel to visit my friends from other universities.  <br>

From my studies at RMIT I hope to benefit in many fields regarding technology, programming being one of the main goals, (hopefully learning various languages). During my studies I am also hoping to discover more friends to get along with, creating more memories and different experiences. Furthermore, I look to participate in various events during my studies at RMIT. <br>

<h1>Ideal Job<h1>
<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/51718668?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=27ec2b67-5184-4c48-bdf7-a8d35708bf2a <br>
This position is appealing as it makes use of various systems which I am familiar with alongside the fact software development intrigues me. This position would utilise Java, C# and SQL, to demonstrate knowledge on software development in order to create education applications for a variety of audiences. <br>
 
The skills and qualifications required to utilise this position would be advanced knowledge and adept application of Java, C# and SQL, while also being creative and able to adapt to new ideas which will allow you to create the optimal education app. While you must also strive to seek solutions for all problems you encounter, while also being able to work efficiently in groups. <br>

Currently, i have base knowledge of SQL and know little to non of C# and Java. Although I do fulfill the role of striving to seek solutions and adapt to new ideas forwarded towards me, additionally i can work together with a group well and enhance my own work though others. <br>

<h1>Personal Profile<h1>
<p>
The reading I achieved from www.16personalities.com/ was ENTP- T (Debater). <br>

http://www.educationplanner.org/ indicates that I'm an auditory/tactile learner. <br>

On the big five personality test on https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/  my score is as followed; <br>
<img src="big_five.jpg" width="533" height="123"> <br>

These results don't mean all that much to me as i already know that this was around the result i was going to achieve so it doesn't come as a surprise to me, these results may influence my behaviour in a team as i am more likely to be a facilitator to the team and ensure that we are all participating in group discussion as well as everyone providing ideas. I should also take this into account when forming a team to ensure not everyone is extroverted and have the same personality type as me since it may cause conflict within our group.<p>
<h1>Project Idea<h1>
<p>Fire Brigade Robots (F.B.R)
 
Fire brigade robots would be a fire extinguishing force primarily composed of robots, they would use innovative technology to extinguish a variety of fires, small to large in a swift manner, in which no one would come to harm. The robots would come in varying sizes, from light work to heavy duty depending on the severity of the fire. <br>

In light of the recent Australian bushfires, these robots were designed to save lives, over 75 firefighters died in the 2019-2020 bushfires, and bots could drastically change that number. They have the potential to save a substantial amount of lives. Furthermore, they will may also be quicker at the job as the risks are lower, hence they may be deployed more swiftly, coincidentally saving many more lives that may have been lost just minutes after. <br>

The fire brigade robots (F.B.R) will be mainly constructed of aluminum alloys for their lightweight and heat resistant properties, they will be coded using mainly C++ and python, being controlled from a tablet at an experts hand and having an interface which allows them to successfully dispose of fires is a variety of scenarios, although they specialise in close quarter fires in places such as houses and offices . They will also be equipped with various new devices such as a fire extinguishing bomb, using an extremely powerful vacuum to extinguish fires. Alongside this they will also be using an inbuilt tradition fire extinguisher and a high pressure hose. The F.B.R will also hold a heavy duty mask to give to victims they are saving. Speakers will be included within to communicate with the people they are rescuing, this is to ensure all correct protocols are followed. Additionally an anti soot camera will be attached to the body of the robot which will ensure the operator has no problems running the robot. Additionally, fully automated F.B.R will be available for commercial purchase, to be placed within homes or offices, they will be sold with a docking station with no additional cost in order for the F.B.R to charge. These models will be equipped with a fire alarm which will automatically activate the bot, in the case of false alarms, there will be an app associated with the bot to shut it down remotely. This app will also include the battery percentage of the bot, as well as any problems with the robot there may be, if a part of it is not functioning properly, an expert may be called to repair it. The app will also serve to update the bots for new versions regularly. The commercial F.B.R artificial intelligence will have already been through thousands of deep learning generations ensuring they are suitable for home use. <br>

The skills required to operate the F.B.R will be a license to operate through repeated use and several simulations of real world scenarios, there will need to be C++ and python coding along with deep learning simulations for the commercial robot. There are no rare materials or hardware needed to construct a F.B.R. For the commercial use of the bot, all you will need is the app and a docking station to place within your home. <br>

If this project is successful, there may be hundreds upon thousands of lives saved, home alone fires are the biggest killers among household fires, with the commercial F.B.R, it will change the outcome drastically. Saving lives and possessions. Furthermore, it will not require the fire force to explore unfamiliar buildings in dangerous situations. This development will drastically change the approach there is to all types of fires. <br>
